          <p>
            I am a multidisciplinary artist, a designer, a developer(in
            progess), a person who loves to travel, a person who loves to learn,
            a person who loves to create.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I was a child, I have always been interested in the world of
            art and the world of technology. People normally says{' '}
            <mark>Curiosity killed the cat</mark>, maybe this is true, but, for
            me curiosity means fuel and I am always trying to find new things to
            learn and to create.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have started my journey in this world with my toys, lego and a
            cellphone camera were my best friends it came to creating things,
            making stop motion animation(ish) since kid, had made me think about
            all the things and how can I put life on it.
          </p>
          <h5>
            Currently I work with many areas, the main ones are creative coding,
            traditional frame-by-frame animation, illustration and motion
            design. However whenever possible I do flower and landscape
            photography and stop-motion animation.
